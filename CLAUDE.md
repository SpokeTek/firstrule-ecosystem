# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**First Rule Ecosystem** - An ethical AI music licensing platform built with Vite + React + TypeScript + shadcn/ui. Generated by Lovable.dev.

## Development Commands

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview

# Lint code
npm run lint
```

## Tech Stack & Architecture

### Core Technologies
- **Build Tool**: Vite 5.4.19 with SWC
- **Framework**: React 18.3.1 with TypeScript 5.8.3
- **UI Library**: shadcn/ui (45+ components built on Radix UI)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **State Management**: React Query (TanStack Query) for server state
- **Backend**: Supabase for database and authentication

## Application Architecture

### Routing
- **/**: Landing page - Hero section for AI music licensing
- **/vault**: Artist Vault - Multi-step form for voice licensing (lazy-loaded)
- Wildcard: 404 handling

### Component Patterns
- UI components follow atomic design in `/components/ui/`
- Page components in `/pages/` handle route-level logic
- Custom hooks in `/hooks/` for reusable stateful logic
- Path alias `@/*` maps to `./src/*`

### State Management
- **React Query**: Server state with QueryClient
- **Local State**: React useState for component state
- **Context**: TooltipProvider for global tooltips

## Design System

### Dark Theme Colors
- **Primary**: Purple (270° 80% 60%)
- **Secondary**: Cyan (190° 90% 50%)
- **Background**: Very dark blue (220° 30% 4%)
- Custom gradients and glow effects throughout

### Custom CSS Variables
- HSL-based color system in `index.css`
- Custom gradients: `--hero-gradient`, `--card-gradient`, `--accent-gradient`
- Smooth transitions with cubic-bezier easing

## Backend Integration

### Supabase Configuration
- **Project ID**: thnusgshpnktmphivphf
- Auto-generated TypeScript client
- localStorage persistence with auto-refresh
- Migration-ready structure

## Key Features

### Artist Vault Application
Multi-step form process:
1. Artist registration (name, email)
2. Voice sample upload
3. AI model configuration
4. Licensing terms setup

### File Upload System
- Drag-and-drop support
- Multiple file management
- Toast notifications (sonner)

## Development Patterns

### Code Quality
- TypeScript with relaxed settings (noImplicitAny: false)
- ESLint with React Hooks and React Refresh rules
- React Query DevTools integration available

### Performance
- Lazy loading for route components
- Vite's optimized bundling
- SWC for fast compilation

## Architecture Notes

- Modern React patterns with hooks and functional components
- Comprehensive shadcn/ui component library for consistency
- Type-safe database integration through Supabase
- Scalable file organization with clear separation of concerns
- Performance optimized with lazy loading and modern tooling
